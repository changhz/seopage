    <h1>How to Ripen Avocados Faster</h1>
    <p>
      Avocados do not ripen on the tree; they ripen or “soften” after they have
      been harvested.
    </p>
    <p>
      To speed up the avocado ripening process we recommend placing unripe
      avocados in a brown paper bag with an apple or banana for two to three
      days until they are ripe.
